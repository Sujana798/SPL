. Frank standi in the doorway, says nothing. 
           CORA You son of a bitch.

He stops. The cub fidgets slightly and emits another very small growl. 
We're scum, CORA Frank. You and I. I knew it when I first met you, and we will never change.
She pours herself another drink. 	Frank throws the gun 
on the bed and sits, listlessly, on a chair. 
We are nothing but two tramps. .. CORA 
We're killers ... we don't deserve to live. 
on the bed next to the gun. Frank takes papers from jacket pocket and tosses them 
What's that? CORA 
Your confession. FRANK 
Cora nods to herself, gets up, picks up the confession and gives it a desultory look. She picks up the gun, idly, as one might unconsciously pick up an object on a coffee table. 
I don't need it ... I never CORA needed it. 	They can't do any thing to me. 	They tried me once and they can't touch me now. 
She starts toward the door to the stairs. 
(over her shoulder) CORA 
But they can try you, Frank.

FRANK 
Where are you going?

           CORA Hello? 
	Frank steps into her. 	Slaps her in the mouth. 	She drops 
the phone and the gun and breaks into profound sobs. A beat. A man's voice heard faintly over the telephone: "Hello? Hello? ... Hello?" Frank reaches down, picks 
up gun, hangs up phone. Cora continues sobbing as if she would never stop. Frank shakes his head, confused. Cora continues sobbing. Impulsively, like a man in great pain 
punching a wall, Frank fires the gun in the direction away from Cora. 	He takes a step toward her, she cowers. 	He is reaching for the phone, pulls the cord out of the wall, smashes the receiver to the floor, and stalks away.  
. ANGLE 
Frank walks to a booth on the far side of the restaurant. He plops down into the booth. 	Cora is fixed as if catatonic, where she was, near the phone, still sobbing. 	Suddenly she

CORA 
We can't get married in one day. It takes three days. 
FRANK 
(surprised, touched, 
starts laughing cleeply) 
Then we'll go take the test. We'll start. 
He gets up, starts to open the door to go inside. 
CORA 
Is that what you want to do? 
           FRANK Yes.

Frank reaches up and raises the collar on her coat. It looks prettier to him. Cora moves closer to him, puts her head on his shoulder.
